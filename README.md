A4

In this code I have 6 files. In a4, this is the branching process that prompts users input and gives them instructions. 
In ui.py holds the functions, this is where all the actions for the commands are, like loading and opening a file. 
OpenWeather is the file that holds the API information and processes it. It will load the data, convert the response from json to python, 
and transclude the @weather keyword into the proper message. LastFM is the same idea, except with the key word @lastfm. 
WebAPI is the file that has the parent class of its children classes, OpenWeather and LastFM. set_apikey and _download_data are inherited. 
Lastly, Profile.py is the file from a3 when we learned how to post. It holds the classes and information to post on the platform and retains 
all the variables in the __init__ function.
